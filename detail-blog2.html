                <p>After producing the upcoming documentary “The Blue Angels,” J.J. Abrams and Glen Powell are in early talks to team up for a new movie, with Abrams eyeing Powell to star in his next directorial effort.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Deals have yet to close, but in the aftermath of “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Anyone but You,” no one’s career has been hotter than Powell’s, who continues to garner interest from big-name filmmakers and studios.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>There’s no telling when this project would fit into Powell’s jam-packed production schedule. He’ll next be seen starring in Netflix’s “Hit Man,” which he also co-wrote with director Richard Linklater, but he’s also set to star in Edgar Wright’s “The Running Man” reboot for Paramount. That news was revealed at CinemaCon, where the actor also promoted Universal’s “Twisters” as a prospective summer blockbuster. Also in the works is “Chad Powers,” a half-hour comedy set at Hulu with “Loki” creator Michael Waldron based on the character created by Eli Manning for his EPSN+ docuseries “Eli’s Places.”</p>    
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Earlier Wednesday, news broke that Powell will star opposite Anthony Mackie and Oscar winner Laura Dern in John Lee Hancock’s “Monsanto,” which is positioned to be a hot package at the Cannes Film Festival market.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In March, Variety’s Tatiana Siegel and Rebecca Rubin examined Powell’s rising profile as one of a “new talent base of bankable stars.” The report predicted his asking price could soon skyrocket thanks to the box office success of “Anyone but You,” which was particularly impressive due to the fact the R-rated romantic comedy wasn’t based on pre-branded intellectual property.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  “Glen is the classic example of talent meeting opportunity,” said Tom Rothman, chairman and CEO of Sony’s Motion Picture Group, attributing the film’s success to both the power of the theatrical experience and Powell’s “truly charismatic screen presence.”

                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Likewise, Abrams has long been a champion of Powell’s, including hosting a special screening of the first feature he executive produced, 2022’s “Devotion,” which was directed by J.D. Dillard, who got his start at Bad Robot. Abrams and the company are next producing “Flowervale Street” from writer-director David Robert Mitchell. The mystery-thriller stars Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor and is set for a May 2025 release under Bad Robot’s deal at Warner Bros.

                <p>
                  “The Blue Angels” documentary, which focuses on the squad of elite Navy pilots, hits IMAX theaters on May 17 for a one-week-only run before streaming globally via Prime Video beginning May 23.

                  Abrams and Powell are both represented by CAA. Powell is also repped by Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.
                  
                  The Insneider was first to report news of Powell’s involvement. Representatives had no comment.
